# CISSP-Study-Guide
I have assisted colleagues with studying and passing the [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP) exam.  
I created this study guide to assist others in studying for this exam.

## Schedule and Pay for the Exam
In any endeavor, committment and persistence are the keys to success. 
The first step in stuyding is to [register](https://www.isc2.org/Register-for-Exam) for the exam.
Initially, I gave myself four months to study since I had a full time job and a family.  
After finishing reading all the material below, I needed another month to go over practice questions and practice exams.  
Studying time varies with each person, allow enough flexibility to provide breathing room, but enough rigidity to stay focus.  
By scheduling the exam, you are committing your mind, body, and wallet to studying.

## Post-Exam Reflections
- Think like a Manager, not a techie. Kelly was right!
