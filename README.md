# CISSP-Study-Guide
I created this study guide to help cyber professionals pass the [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP) exam.  

## Schedule and Pay for the Exam
- The first step in stuyding is to [register](https://www.isc2.org/Register-for-Exam) for the exam.
- Initially, I gave myself four months to study since I had a full time job and a family.  
After reading all the material below, I needed another month to go over practice questions and practice exams.  
- Studying time varies with each person, allow enough flexibility to provide breathing room, but enough structure to stay focus.  
- With scheduling the exam, you are committing your mind, body, and wallet to studying.

## Visual Success
- Each morning and evening I wrote, **I will pass the CISSP on my first try!**, ten times.
- Visualization of success helps with motivation and staying positive when navigating through uncertainty.

## Study and Sit for an intro Cloud Certification Exam
- By studying for and passing an introductory cloud exam, I built good study habits and gained confidence.
- In addition, basic security principles are covered in the exam.

## Post-Exam Reflections
- Think like a Manager, not a techie. Follow the process! [Kelly Handerhan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A&t=90s&ab_channel=KellyHanderhan) was right!
- [Spock vs Captain Kirk!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG9JN9X4_ZI&ab_channel=MaxQuasar)  Thanks Larry. 
- The CISSP exam is not just a cybersecurity exam but a comprehension exam. 
- Take your time to understand what the ask is in the question.
- View Larry Greenblatt's CISSP videos as many times as possible in order to understand the mindset for answering questions on the CISSP exam.
- Set aside a month to take and to review practice exam questions.  I went over 3,000 exam questions which helped me identify my weak areas.
- Avoid taking practice exams over and over again.  Understand why an anwer is correct or not, and the underlying cyber principles.

## Resources
These resources were my main areas for studying, but there are many free resources about the CISSP. I limited my resources in order to keep my focus. 

- [CISSP subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cissp/)
- [CCSP](https://ccsp.alukos.com/) I found this website after I took my exam but it is great site for security principles/laws that are covered in the CISSP.
